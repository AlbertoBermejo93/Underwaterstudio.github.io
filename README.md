Navbar project


<!-- Project in process -->


Small navbar project using the "burger" menu, this is my first project using Javascript.


I had been looking for a navbar design that I liked visually on the internet and I came across this video wich presented a clean design with some javascript 
and I decided to give it a try and build my own.

NOTE ! 

At the moment I'm having some issues when I try to publish the website on Github.

I am looking for a solution to upload the website ASAP! 

Thank you!
